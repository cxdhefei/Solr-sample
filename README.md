# Solr-sample
This is simple solr/solrcloud insert/search code sample. I hope "SolrApi.java" and "SolrCloudApi.java" are helpful for you. Installing and configuring solr is out of range in this document. But because Solr 5.4 is well developed, this program will work even if you don't configure solrconfig.xml and solrsetting.xml. All you need is setting the URL solr is running.


## Requirement
- Solr 5.4.0
- Java 1.8
- Maven 3.3.3


## Prerequisite
1. Download [Solr](http://lucene.apache.org/solr/)
1. Run solr.
